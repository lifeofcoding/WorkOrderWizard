routes


	user routes
	customer routes
		get all customers (for logged in user)  (DONE, except auhorization bit: GET /customer/all )
		get one customer (of user's customers)  (DONE, except auhorization bit: GET /customer/:id )
		
		add a customer (associated to logged in user)
		remove a customer (mark customer deleted / archived)
		
	workorder routes
		get all workorders 
		get one workorder
		
		create a workorder
		remove a workorder (mark deleted/archived)
		
	invoice routes
		get all invoices 
		get one invoice
		
		add an invoice to a workorder
		remove an invoice from a workorder (mark deleted/archived)
		
	cost routes
		get all costs
		get one cost
		
		add cost to a workorder
		remove a cost from a workorder (mark deleted / archived)
		
		
Schema:

	Customers collection
	Workorders collection
	Invoices collection
	Costs collection
	Users Collection
	
OR, hierarcical:
	
	users {
		Customers {
			Workorders {
				Invoices {}
				Costs {}
			}
		}
	}
	
Again hierarcical, but different:
	
	users {}
	
	Customers {}
			
	Workorders {
		Invoices {}
		Costs {}
	}
	
	
	Because I probably want to nest Costs and Invoices within the document of their parent workOrder (at least as long as I am using MongoDB), I will start implementing the workOrder routes first, using a WorkOrders collection. But I already have a Customers collections so I can use that to build these customer routes.
		
Either way, these objects should have the following properties / columns:

		
	Customers : {
		name: string,
		businessName: string,
		phone: string,
		emailAddress: string,
		Address: string
	};
	
	Workorders : {
		customerID (if nested hierarcically this is not needed, it is the parent ID),
		created on DATE,
		Due DATE,
		hoursLogged: number
	};
	
	Invoices : {
		paid: boolean,
		open: boolean,
		amountBilled: number,
		dateIssued: date
		
	};
	
	Costs : {
		amount: number
		datePurchased: DATE,
		vendor: string,
		vendorReceiptSN (unique receipt transaction ID from vendor receipt, if any)
	};
	
	Users : {
	
	};
